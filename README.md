# Angular4Movieapp

This `Movie Application` uses [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to fetch movie details.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Backend

Backend for this application is available in this [Repo](https://github.com/vibakar/golang-movieapp.git). Backend will run on port `8080`. If the backend port is changed, the same port has to be updated in `proxy.conf.json`
